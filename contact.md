contact information, jane avriette
====
I keep a phone number, 858-367-7293, which tries to be pointed at whatever  
mechanism is the best way to reach me at the moment. This means I get SMS's,  
voice mails, phone calls, and emails via that phone number.  

You may also email me at [jane@cpan.org](mailto:jane@cpan.org)  

In order of preference, I prefer communication via email, sms, instant  
message, and lastly via phone or voice.  

With respect to communication, as I live in the Eastern/New_York time  
zone, you can expect me to be paying attention to communications between  
roughly **9am and 6pm** my own time.

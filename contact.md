contact information, jane arc

I keep a phone number, 858-367-7293, which tries to be pointed at whatever
mechanism is the best way to reach me at the moment. This means I get SMS&apos;s,
voice mails, phone calls, and emails via that phone number.

You may also email me at [jane@cpan.org](mailto:jane@cpan.org)

In order of preference, I prefer communication via email, sms, instant
message, and lastly via phone or voice.

With respect to communication, as I live in the America/Tijuana time
zone, you can expect me to be paying attention to communications between
roughly **7am and 6pm** my own time.

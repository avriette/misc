lensmaker's formula:
1/f = (n-1) [1/r1 - 1/r2 + ((n - 1)d)/n*r1*r2]

f = focal length
n = refractive index of the material
r1 = radius of the near curvature (to light source)
r2 = radius of the far curvature
d = thickness of the lens (the distance between top and bottom)

the refraction of light is dictated by its distance from the center of the
lens. this means that light in the center of the lens goes straight through,
and light going through the near-perimeter is the most refracted.

importantly, refraction is equal given an equal radius. thus theoretically,
this means there are an infinite number of points around a radius of a lens
which will focus to the same focal length.

refractive indices:

pyrex: 1.470
flint glass: 1.52

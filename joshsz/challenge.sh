## Task 1
# determine latest ubuntu lts ami id

#  So, as it happens, the schema returned by aws ec2 describe-images doesn't
#  actually include the date the ami was created, any specific keys re the OS
#  version, and the naming ontology is really poor (it's all freeform rather
#  than organised in any way). Therefore it would seem to not be
#  programmatically possible to 'ascertain' the latest-n-greatest e.g., ubuntu
#  LTS image. So we hard-code this here.
UBUNTU_LTS_AMI_ID="ami-358c955c" # note this is 32-bit
aws ec2 describe-images --image-ids $UBUNTU_LTS_AMI_ID


## Task 2
# use public key from:
#  https://s3.amazonaws.com/optoro-corp/opsrsrc/id_rsa.pub
# for 'ubuntu' user

## Task 3
# launch an m1.small instance
aws opsworks create-instance --ami-id $UBUNTU_LTS_AMI_ID

# install this file:
#   https://s3.amazonaws.com/optoro-corp/opsrsrc/optoro
# into /usr/local/bin/optoro

# execute that file

# For some reason awscli will not allow me to use us-east-1d, but us-east

# that's mildly annoying if it doesn't allow me to specify a specifici
# sub-region for the node.

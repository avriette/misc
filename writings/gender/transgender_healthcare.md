#### Transgender healthcare is an abject failure in America

I recently transitioned from working for [private industry](http://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2012/01/23/booz-allen-cyber-network.aspx) to the [public sector](https://18f.gsa.gov/). I am really happy with this transition, actually (and may write more on it at a later date).

What has really been shocking for me, however, is the difference in healthcare.

Before coming to work for government, I had heard just about everywhere that “the government has great health benefits.” I had heard about the [miseries of tricare](https://www.change.org/p/tell-the-dod-tricare-to-stop-failing-military-beneficiaries-in-pain), but I had largely assumed this was a sort of defense-specific thing. When I worked for Microsoft, I spent a lot of time talking to government workers, specifically at Postal, who would talk at length about the “great benefits” the government had. I suppose I did not consider at the time that most of these people were career civil employees (many having tenure exceeding fifteen years).

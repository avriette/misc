####Getting voted off the island: deflation pressure in online communities

It's really kind of interesting to watch the social dynamics of online communities, if you can do so without yourself being in some way affected.

I was struck today by the notion that in order for an online community to thrive, it must remain interesting – to anyone. What purpose, after all, is a community, with no members, or whose members are inactive? If we allow an online community to grow, boundlessly, we reduce the ability of individual members to relate to each other, and instead they must relate to the purpose they are gathered there for.

Over time, this purpose can become ambiguous, especially as the purpose of the community itself becomes the people in the community. Picture a rough timeline:

A small kernel of people
A community is formed to discuss SUBJECT.

####Getting voted off the island: deflation pressure in online communities

#####Or how your IRC channel is like a star.

It is really kind of interesting to watch the social dynamics of online communities, if you can do so without yourself being in some way affected.

I was struck today by the notion that in order for an online community to thrive, it must remain interesting – to anyone. What purpose, after all, is a community, with no members, or whose members are inactive? If we allow an online community to grow, boundlessly, we reduce the ability of individual members to relate to each other, and instead they must relate to the purpose they are gathered there for.

Over time, this purpose can become ambiguous, especially as the purpose of the community itself becomes the people in the community.

1. A small kernel of people self-realises their collective relation to SUBJECT.
* A formal community is created to discuss SUBJECT.
* The formal community fosters interpersonal discourse and communication, cementing existing interpersonal bonds and creating new connections for e.g., people who were previously two-degrees removed, et cetera.
* As people outside the community hear about SUBJECT (& or community itself), new members arrive and are indoctrinated to the community.
* The voice of new members begins to somewhat drown out the original voices of the founding members, and the purpose of the community, SUBJECT, is held up by new members for newer members. Concentric spheres of newer and newer members, drifting further and further from the original kernel of the community, and the interconnections in step 3.

At this point I have seen a couple things happen.

The first scenario is a sort of gradual-death of the community as a place that is a social setting, and it begins to more represent a repository of information about SUBJECT, rather than a group of people interested in SUBJECT. This is usually accompanied by large efforts to commit-to-paper all the knowledge known by community. This serves to perpetuate monoculture (of the newer users more than the original, “kernel” users, which is by definition more dilute and diffuse) by creating indoctrination processes for new users, and removing the “initial interaction” with the newest users to places further from the older (“deeper in the sphere”) users.

Usually what happens in this first scenario is many (or all) of the original, founding, “kernel” members of the community leave, and torches are passed; if the community at this point doesn’t outright fail (and usually it does), the process of recording all the shared knowledge in a place (itself an attempt to defeat the imminent death of the community) is long and intractable, and fraught with arguing (because who gets to write the history and shared knowledge for the new users, cementing what the culture of the community will be, going forward? This is important, and everyone is aware of it at the time; it’s political.). I have seen several times where this just never quite ends and you have a very long tail that ultimately results in dispersal and loss of all the information (via sites going down, archives not being made, “taking the ball and going home,” and so forth).

A great example of the first case is the steady homogenisation and [death of Wikipedia between 2006 and the present](http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/520446/the-decline-of-wikipedia/), which has been studied rather extensively and seems to be incurable, even with investor money.

The second scenario is different. This time, the original kernel of the community is aware of the influx of new users, and a drift from *the original culture of the community* rather than SUBJECT. The difference here is very important. A choice is made at this point by the founders or “sufficiently old” members of the community that *the community itself and its culture* are more vital than the stated purpose of SUBJECT.

Very rapidly a vigilant xenophobia develops, and there is a feeling of “all these new users,” and words like “riff-raff” are used to describe people who are new to the community. Users can be extensively vetted to ensure they “fit the community culture” and smoke screens like “[cultural fit](http://www.ragingwisdom.com/is-interviewing-for-cultural-fit-an-illegal-form-of-employment-discrimination/)” before being granted “full membership” in the culture, or conveyed privileges (such as editing a knowledge base, “post per day” limits, and so forth).

What happens is the purpose of the community becomes the community itself, rather than SUBJECT. While superficially this may seem like an agreeable situation to the people *in* the community, it is pretty ugly for both new users (who believe the community to be about SUBJECT) or for less-new users who are not “drinking the kool-aid” or have not made sufficient political connections (read: friendships and political capital) in the community.

A type of deflation occurs where the community itself, the time of its members, the moral/cultural structure of its environment are viewed as a precious commodity; people who consume this resource and do not “sufficiently contribute” (as adjudged by older, “deeper-in,” to continue the analogy, members) appear to be consuming an incongruent amount and are often portrayed as “problem users,” “freeloaders,” and so forth.

After this process sets in, the death of the community is a certainty. Witch hunts begin, and deeper, older, more politically powerful people within the community begin to search for people to eject from the community. It may not be immediately clear even to them that their goal is to retain cultural power over the community, to preserve the structure they see as inherent and ingrained and inviolable, and that difference and heterogeneity within the community are destructive forces. Frequently, not even lip service is paid to SUBJECT at this point. Members are deemed “toxic” and quickly (often quietly, so as not to invite questions about whether this is true to the stated purpose of SUBJECT) “voted off the island.” Although in this case, it only takes a couple of sufficiently powerful votes, rather than consensus; in this model, the people deeper in the sphere have increased political capital proportional to their depth/age in the community.

#####As it happens, fusion is hard to sustain.

We see a very similar pattern in nature. Gravity seems pretty good at getting fusion reactions going, generally speaking. The problem actually arises in the balance between pouring mass into the reaction but *not too much*, and a static balance of consumption vs radiation.

We can on the one hand see a community that grows larger and larger, becoming more and more diffuse as it expands, until all that remains are traces and echos, nebulae signifying that something was there, despite the core being quite cold and vacant.

And on the other, we see a collapse. We see a core of cold, ideologically immutable, usually quite bitter people protecting what remains of the community, even burning brightly, but which ultimately will also fail due to starvation for new resources in the form of people and culture (read: diversity).

Or to put it simply, communities can and frequently *do* die from a lack of in-falling diversity. This being said, it is incredibly important to “monitor the reaction.” Remember that you have both a community and a purpose. Tend to the purpose, and tend to the community, but be very careful to sacrifice one to feed the other. The key is a balance between ingress and egress.

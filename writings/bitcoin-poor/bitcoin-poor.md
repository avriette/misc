# Is bitcoin actually a good thing for the poor?

* deflation vs holding
* creates a new oligarchy of early adopters who by definition are not in the third world
* requires technological infrastructure that may be there already
* how does one buy-in to the economy?
	* what is the exchange rate for goats<->bitcoin?
* here, this is radical, maybe somebody should aggregate ten billion dollars or something in a currency that’s not meshed with bitcoin or other developed-world currencies, and start handing that out in africa, and use /that/ for currency, with the same niceties of bitcoin.
	* obviously, this can’t work. currencies, including bitcoin, work on scarcity.
	* how about ostrich beads then? 
		* there has to be a unit-work or unit-value for a currency. this ultimately favors the not-disabled and the currently-privileged and progenitors.
	* is the answer that currency itself is the problem?
		* this is my thought.

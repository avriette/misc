I have started tipping Uber drivers.
I try to be as responsible as I can with my consumption. I don't buy from brands I don't like, I don't spend at chains I don't want to support, and I don't spend my money where I don't want it to go. I am exceptionally cautious about this.
And so I am in something of a quandary with Uber, whose business I believe in very much. As a person who is disabled, I believe that Uber is a huge enabler of people, and is creating a system that will do amazing things for society that we have not even begun to imagine yet.
But I take easily seventy-five rides a month. I talk to these people. I ask them how their day was. I spend between seven minutes and an hour with them. Sometimes more. They are all carrying the same burden, of people trying desperately hard to make money in a very hard economy.
And I can't anymore be the person in the back of their car who represents possibly negative income on a promise that may not actually be fulfilled based upon an algorithm that may or may not be working.
Cash is meaningful, in a limited way. I can certainly pay them more. I pay my manicurist, hair stylist, wait staff, and damned near every other person I have a commerce relationship with, more, because the service is valuable to me, and I am in a position of privilege.
It is the least we could do to acknowledge this.

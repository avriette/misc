I wish to expand on my earlier complaints about the term "tech bros," in which I explained that it erases the presence of women in technology sector.
The other thing the use of this term does is it genders the work of the technology sector as inherently masculine. That, further, as we on the one hand are erasing women from engineering by using the stereotype of the male engineer, we are also saying that the product of all engineering is masculine.
All this shit, that you're using, to bitch and moan, about tech bros, was built, by, among other people, fucking women. There weren't "tech bros" then, there aren't now. The technology sector is a vast, vibrant spectrum of people of all genders and ethnic backgrounds and neurological makeups.
Our work is vast, it encompasses literally everything. And it's not goddamned masculine.
Creating this monolith of technology and then tying it to gender is just really offensive. I think it is a very regressive thing to do, and it is especially pernicious to see it in a community like the Bay Area that prides itself on not being quite so regressive.
Is literally nobody else noticing that this term is vile?

The fact that we need to disclaim this discussion should be indication enough that there is something Really Wrong with the Bay.
I think linked piece is a mostly well-written opinion piece, and seems to be well-supported, but misses an extremely important piece of information. I want to pull out a relevant quote:
"The bottom line is that the ambition level in Silicon Valley and New York is simply off the charts. That kind of ambition is not what you find in Chicago (or pretty much anywhere else)."
There is this ambition in the Bay (as defined as roughly the area between, say, Palo Alto and Oakland). But there's also a lot of people there who are just along for the terrible, terrible ride. And furthermore, there are people with this ambition in other places – DC comes to mind (and is mentioned in this piece) – wherein people work a casual sixty hours a week and go home to their spouse and two dogs. Every week. Well, nearly every week. DC has a habit of occasionally having wars and terrorist attacks and things like this. I digress.
The point is, in the Bay, working sixty hours a week is a good *start*. Not having a fanatical devotion to your laundry startup and putting in eighty is a great way to get fired or simply pushed out by being stack-ranked against your peers and simply rated as underperforming until you either quit, you increase the number of hours up to some ludicrous number, or they fire you.
In DC, they explicitly counsel you against this. The term is called "wage dilution." If you work eighty hours a week, and you are paid for forty, even though you are being paid $150,000 a year, surprise! You are in fact being paid $75,000 a year, because you are working two years *per* *year*.
This is in fact gendered; men in the workplace are less affected by this. If you are a man in a workplace that operates like this (and we don't need to prove that tech companies are by and large full of men), and you have an intimate partner (and we know by the numbers that most men are heterosexual), they may or may not be at a tech company, but chances are they are doing things like:
- making sure your refrigerator has food in it
- possibly making sure a houseplant can survive in your home
- making your home habitable for a mammal (these are called "cats" or "dogs" but cannot survive at home while you are working for multiple twelve to fourteen hour days and it's 95°F in your apartment)
- listening to you when you come home with the latest story about how $project is really awful
- doing the keeping in touch with friends and family while you are busy throwing yourself at work
So women are doing the emotional labour of everyone in tech companies. Women are sustaining the pace of this inane "ambition" – which is, literally, abusive, and not in fact ambition – by keeping them alive, their homes habitable, caring for them.
Ambition is saying "I want to go and build something big, something amazing, something new, something huge and unheard of." And then going and doing it.
It does not mean that you have to subjugate thousands upon thousands of people while you do it. Go put in your round-the-clock, I-only-need-four-hours-of-sleep days because you're-Thomas-Alva-Goddam-Edison. You be ambitious. You. Go do it.
I have met, in twenty-two years, fewer than two dozen people that could keep up that kind of pace indefinitely (as far as I could tell). Every single one of them was a man, every single one of them had a partner at home, who was taking care of them. I posit this is not an accident.
The Bay is a kind of a sad museum of burnouts and this sharp shock wave of people who hate "techies." I can't say I really blame them – the culture is repugnant.
The point I would make, though, is that most of the people caught up in Bay Area tech culture are people who *need a job*, and who are working because they like what they do. For whatever reason, they got started here (I have met *so many* twenty-mumble-year-olds) who just have no idea that it is possible to build planet-scale (if you are in fact ambitious and want to do Big Things) systems outside the Bay, without burning out, without spending $3,000 plus on rent, while maintaining a healthy set of boundaries, and even while pursuing (dare I suggest it) non-work pursuits.
Start with a place like DC. Or Seattle. Or Portland. There are a lot of places to be ambitious and to Great Big Things that don't involve throwing your life into the meat grinder that is Bay Area tech culture.

Gentle reminder that I am not just now a woman, that I need not be "welcomed to being a woman," and so forth. I don't need to go into further detail, but I will say that I have indeed lost everything I cared about in this transition (except two very dear friends). It has been ruinous and painful in ways that cis people will never, can never, understand.
Let's try this again.
Welcome to realising I'm a woman.
Welcome to being cis. You can be a better cis person by not invalidating everything I've worked for, erasing my loss, the loss my wife and family have endured, and the years I lived as a trans woman in closet. I was a woman then, I'm a woman now, and the fact that I need to state this is pretty upsetting.
You have literally had years, cis people. Years.

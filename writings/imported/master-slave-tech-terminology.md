I have been reading Kindred, by Octavia Butler, and I had to give it a couple days' rest. The book includes first-person narratives of antebellum America–slavery.
The reason I had to stop reading this book is I keep hearing these words, "master," and "slave," in use at work (each time, making me faintly nauseated). There has been an effort in recent years in Software Engineering to stop using these words.
When we use the word "slave" to refer to an instance of a database that is a replica of another instance of a database, we demean every *person* who was ever a slave. When we create, with words, "master-slave" relationships between databases and other software processes, we demean ourselves. Slavery is repugnant. Humanity strives to end slavery, everywhere.
How is it that we as software engineers tolerate the use of these words, anywhere? How is it that we not just tolerate the use of these words, but we invoke the meaning of the entire system by bringing in the relationship of masters and slaves with it?
I find myself becoming ever more nauseated–physically sick–when people are using these words around me. And I am not a person of colour.
Would someone please explain to me why anyone thinks this is still an okay phrasing to use? Or, better yet, don't. Let's change this.

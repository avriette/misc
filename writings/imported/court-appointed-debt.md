The thing that has kept me locked into Apple devices since the day I swore never to buy another (and in fact I haven't) is the fact that I have something like thirty thousand tracks purchased in the iTunes store (with still more in television and movies).
Google is offering this:

Which includes this:

But of course (I haven't tried today), my guess is this does not get us around DRM, which is the whole point of vendor lock in.
I recall listening to a shareholder call wherein someone asked Steve after the release of the early iPods, and it was clear that iTunes tracks were not going to be very profitable (they may be today, this was a long, long time ago) iTunes exists to sell devices, which exists to get people on the platform.
And look what a great job it's done at that. People do not even question the craven vendor lock in that Apple enjoys today, about which Microsoft would have been pilloried and sued for in the nineties.
Even *if* Google does have a cute way around the DRM on these tracks, I will be annoyed because if I had come up with such a way on my own in 2003, I'd have been sued by Apple (and in fact people were; one such settled and was given a job).
I am unsure why we continue to allow this sort of thing. We knew DRM was bad fifteen years ago, we know it's bad today, we know the secondary consequences (like lock in).
Maybe we should start calling DRM court appointed technical debt which is shouldered by the proletariat.

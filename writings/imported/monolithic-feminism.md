I had breakfast this morning with an ardent self-identifying feminist. Let me state first that feminism is not a monolith.
This woman seemed to understand that Uber as an entity contains a power dynamic which can be read as both empowering and as exploitation. She understood that labour organisation was a good fight and we talked about Bernie Sanders' ideas and that it hurt we couldn't get such a push to empowering people from Hillary -- whom both of us want to support based solely on fatigue of men in the executive. She was clearly smart and empathetic.
But she also argued that organised crime was good for Las Vegas. That sex work was unsightly (cf empowering, cf exploitative, anything -- she just didn't want to see it). She repeatedly misgendered me despite numerous corrections by me, and none of the staff getting it wrong even once.
There is talk, today, of a fourth wave of feminism forming. This woman obviously hails from the second wave. I used to think of myself as a third wave feminist, but I came to become saddened by the lack of understanding of both myself as a trans person, and of people I knew who were braver, forging even more radical identities than I do.
So maybe we should just stop talking about "waves" of feminism. You either are, or you aren't.
If your feminism isn't intersectional, doesn't support nonbinary people, people of colour, fully integrate power dynamics and exploitation, and leave itself forever curious to expand and build a better feminism, it just may be bullshit.
We should stop making "sequels" to feminism, and we should instead start deprecating, by teaching, harmful ideologies and ideas.
Maybe feminism ought to be a monolith.

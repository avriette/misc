Can we talk about how the TSA has both created a process (airport screenings) that it is so odious and time consuming that it acknowledges nobody wants to go through it, and that it mistreats people going through this process, and that it apologises for mistreating people in this process, *and* has created a system by which people can pay to be exempt from this process (pre-Check)? Ordinarily this would be called extortion, right?
"The practice of obtaining something â€¦ through force or threats."
In the best case, this is bad faith. If your screening process is so bad that it requires a contractor ecosystem to pre-screen passengers, employ that better process to pre-screen *all* passengers, rather than those who can pay a fee (a *huge* fee for most people, and even more for those with families).
If instead, what you aim to do is punish people who are the least able to pay this fee, or to create an atmosphere of fear, or to create substantial friction around travel, congratulations, you have done this.
But fingerprinting rich white people, and infosec workers who formerly had security clearances, and making everyone else go through a scanner that lets you look at their breasts and genitals is not making anyone actually safer.
Precisely how many aircraft have been saved by these shenanigans?

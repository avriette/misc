You're a feminist. This means you're one of the good ones. You are in fact part of making the world a better place.
So why do you feel defensive right now?
The fact of the matter is that intersectional feminism is hard. Without question you have privilege and power over people around you. You may be cis, or neurotypical, or white, or heterosexual; the point is you can be both privileged and oppressed at the same time.
When someone says something, and you find yourself being defensive, you're doing this part wrong. Power and privilege need no defence from you or anyone; these systems exist already to support cisgender people, hetero people, wealthy people, white people, et cetera.
It hurts that I am lumped into these groups when someone says "I want to kill tech workers." But the fact of the matter is it makes sense for a homeless person to say this to me, even if I am doing everything in my power to help. Tech workers don't need my defence against a homeless person. They have the entire global economy behind them.
The same goes for neurotypical people, and cis people, and so on down the line.
If you want to defend a class of people, the first step is realising the inherent power in your position, and acknowledging it. Be vocal about this. Teach other privileged people about it. And, when someone says something to you that makes you feel defensive, think about how much courage it takes to speak that kind of truth to you, who hold all the cards in that situation.
If you feel defensive, you are doing feminism wrong.

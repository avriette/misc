We need to talk about this term, "tech bros."
I work for a company with not-enough, but a whole fucking lot, of *women*. Trans women, cis women, white women, women of colour, queer women, straight women, and people of genders I can't describe.
When you say that "tech bros" are taking over San Francisco, or ruining this or that place, or increasing gentrification, you refer to tech *workers*, and specifically to me.
And that shit is not going to fucking fly. Not. At. All.
Because I have worked too fucking hard to be called a woman for you to call me a fucking bro. And I know what you're thinking, "but I don't mean you, Jane, when I say 'tech bro,' I mean those guys on electric skateboards talking on their phones loudly on the bus."
Except, you do mean me. You mean people with six figure salaries, moving into Oakland from parts unknown. You mean people who have disposable income. Who are somewhat removed from various economic pressures that the rest of the economy is subject to. You mean me. You mean "tech workers."
And so it's cute when you say "tech bros," but you are erasing all the women who have worked so fucking hard to be in that field, and work hard every fucking day to be in that field.
If we are going to have a discussion about the problems that "tech workers" are causing, let's talk about that. And let's talk about capitalism, and the effects of technology and that sector on, literally, America, or The West, as a whole, but this is not some elite cadre of popped-collar "bros," it's all of us.
I will give no quarter on this.
You aren't going to call me – I repeat, me – a "bro" by referring to my company, my sector, my town, and my coworkers, male, female, non-binary, alike – as tech "bros."
Be a fucking adult, use your words, be specific, learn the issues, or shut your fucking mouth.
You cannot be "for social justice" on the one hand, and on the other hand, simultaneously erasing the very hard work of an entire population of women in technology working desperately hard for recognition. Go back and re-read your fucking feminism. I'll wait.
Tech. Workers. Refer to all of us as the problem. Because we are.

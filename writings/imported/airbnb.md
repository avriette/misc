A few weeks ago, Airbnb updated their antidiscrimination policy, and sent all their users (myself included) an email. I include an excerpt of that email here:
"We believe that no matter who you are, where you are from, or where you travel, you should be able to belong in the Airbnb community. By joining this community, you commit to treat all fellow members of this community, regardless of race, religion, national origin, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or age, with respect, and without judgment or bias."
I have long championed in my own workplace, and in workplaces prior, for wording that is this simple, both for internal employees and for people with whom we interact.
When I was an employee of the government, this was an easy feat; the government is required to obey federal law. Federal law, for the most part, stipulates that the government /cannot/ discriminate, and if and when it does, they are /sued/, and they lose.
Private companies, on the other hand, tend to behave badly, and get away with it, for quite a long time, and correct course only when the system becomes so "systematised" that it becomes plain as day, and someone sues and actually *wins*, and then change happens (as I believe we are seeing happen with Peter Thiel's Palantir, today).
I was, if I am honest, surprised to see this come from Airbnb, as "sharing economy" companies are not known for being especially forward thinking in this regard.
That said, when I got the email, I immediately texted friends, and told them; this is amazing.
What is stopping other companies from doing this? We know that codes of conduct for e.g., conferences work. We know that appalling behaviour happens when we combine strangers from the public in private spaces (which is exactly the Airbnb business model). So why not give them some pretty sturdy rules and say "we insist you treat eachother like adults for the time in which there is some kind of monetary exchange going on which we have facilitated," and try to ensure that people are not actively harmed by their system?
It seems to me the least we can do to protect vulnerable populations.

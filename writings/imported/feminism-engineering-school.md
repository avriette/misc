I've been reading a book, Pedagogies of Crossing, by M. Jaqui Alexander. It starts off quite ferociously:
"Women's sexual agency and autonomy have always been troublesome for the state. They pose a challenge to the ideology of an originary nuclear heterosexual family that perpetuates the fiction that the family is the cornerstone of society. Erotic autonomy signals danger to the heterosexual family and to the nation."
The author has put into direct opposition on one hand, the state, heterosexuality, and contemporary society (and called this a fiction), and in the other hand has placed the sexual agency of women and indeed women's agency, full stop.
So the book starts here, with these premises, and proceeds, deftly, to explain and defend, intersectionally, and with such force of intellect every single point made; I kind of feel as though pulled along by a current when I read it on the bus on the morning. I never have any trouble reading, really. I don't struggle to keep up, with anything. If I lack the vocabulary for something, and want to read it, I go read the texts I need to learn the vocabulary, and then go read what it was I want to read.
But I have now been reading feminism for years, with the zeal I read engineering texts. And yet, while I am a "practising feminist," I'm starting to feel like I need to take classes if I want to go any further with this.
I could go back and reread Kant and Locke and Luther and Hobbes and shore up that stuff, but I read it ages ago and I don't think I need to reread it; feminism was built on the top of these things, and specifically liberalism.
I find myself now with all these tools to understand & describe the world around me, that feel as real as engineering, as real as physics itself does. I feel this need to make them sharper, and to hone them. And I find myself, for the nth time in my life thinking that if I want to do this it probably has to happen in a classroom.
But what then does one do with such tools? This may sound like a joke, but exactly what does does one do with a substantial and advanced understanding of feminism? What if one can describe every interaction around them in terms of these dynamics? What then?
And so I read a lot. But it leaves me sad.
Indulge in a thought exercise with me. A group of people awake to find themselves in a dark box. Their goal is to, presumably, leave the box; it is removing their agency; they are confined.
One thing the group of people could do is figure out how they came to be in the box. Figure out how to make sure that everyone in the box, for example, gets enough food and water and so forth. Maybe they even go so far as to infer motives that could be experimentally verified if they were ever to leave the box.
The other approach is the engineer's approach. Measure the box. Determine its dimensions. Determine whether the surface of the box is permeable. Figure out whether an exit is in fact possible.
Feminism leaves us in the box.
Or does it? You see, we can apply the same feminist lens to engineering. But we don't. Because feminism, as women, is largely ignored. What would I do, as a very competent engineer, with exceptionally sharp "feminist tools" (because I assure you, they exist, even if you ignore them)?
Does such a creature exist? What would such a person do? What would their practice of this very hard and "soft" science look like?
Furthermore, why couldn't she exist? The problem is not that it is a contradiction in terms or that the sciences (yes, plural) are mutually exclusive (a feminist engineering discipline is without question possible); the problem is that nobody would "take such a person seriously."
Why is that?
What does that say?

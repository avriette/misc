The federal government is basically Voldemort. We know he's out there, just past earshot, around a blind corner; we are all afraid of him and yet we ignore him and manage in our day to day lives quite well without him.
And then that fucker shows up. Brings an army. Wants to help us reform and Make Things Better and chase away The Bad People. Then you know what a mistake you've made, in just not speaking his name, in hoping things work out and you remain unseen, unheard, un-meddled-with.
But in the end we know what had to happen with Voldemort. We all do. And every time a Voldemort surfaces, it takes a generation, sometimes a couple, but strong people, usually young people, do the right thing.
I just wish we could find the place that keeps producing this evil and raze it to the fucking ground.

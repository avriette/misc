So it's kind of shit to say "I have gay friends!" — but I do, have gay friends. And I don't actually have any gay friends who are the sort to sort of vote the more marginalised queer people off Queer Island.
But this having been said, EF has an interesting piece on this idea of "homonormativity." I think it's kind of a bad term for what is a really toxic, pernicious, and /very real/ part of our community as queer people.
I think for example the notion that polyamorous people are de facto excluded is particularly unsettling. Additionally, nobody seems to want to talk about the idea that marriage, at least as defined monogamously, is inherently hostile to bisexual (and other non-mono sexualities) people.
So what is to be done? We seem to be in a sad state of affairs when we realise it may be necessary to "punch up" some to a group of people historically seen as members of Team Queer — cis gay dudes — but, yet, here we are. It is pretty vexing.
